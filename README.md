# ðŸŽ¹ Piano:

## Quick Harmony

**Play the Melody:**
- Utilize keys from **1 to 5** to awaken the main notes of the piano.

**Sharp Keys:**
- Hold the mystical **Shift key** and tap into the enchanting realm of sharp keys with the keys **1 to 4**.

## Configuration Symphony

Before you embark on this harmonious journey, conduct a quick tune-up by customizing the sound folder path in the `MainWindow.xaml.cs` file:

```csharp
public MainWindow()
{
    InitializeComponent();
    basePath = @"Specify the path for your Sound folder";
}
```

Replace `"Specify the path for your Sound folder"` with the actual path to your sound folder, transforming your coding space into a concert hall of endless possibilities.
